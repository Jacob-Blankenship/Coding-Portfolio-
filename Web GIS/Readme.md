# Routes Merge:
Made this code so that I could merge routes from each exit of a building into one to show all the operation of the routes with having less files to handle.

# Shapefiles Elevation Z geometry:
Made this code so that I could change the elevation of building floors all at once (point, line, polygon files) in a folder

# Stairs Elevation Z Geometry:
Made this code so that I could change the elevation of points made to show the stair ways of buildings so that we could go back and make the stairs in 3D later

# Update Columns:
Made this code so that I could update attribute columns in ArcMap
